> **A noise-aware, auto-response security app for emergency scenarios**

---

## üåê Project Overview

SilentGuard is a smart Android application designed to **detect emergency situations** based on abnormal noise levels in the environment. Upon detecting such a situation, it automatically records audio, transcribes the content into text using **Google Speech-to-Text**, **encrypts** it using **zero-width characters**, and sends it discreetly via **SMS and/or Email** to a preconfigured emergency contact.

Key goals:

* Trigger response **only** when noise exceeds a defined threshold.
* **Encrypt** sensitive transcribed data inside a cover message.
* **Send notifications silently** using Android's Accessibility Services.
* Maintain user safety through automation and discretion.

## üìÇ Project Structure (MVC)

SilentGuard follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture:

|   |-- AudioController.kt
|   |-- EventController.kt
|   |-- MessageController.kt
|   |-- MonitoringController.kt
|   |-- NotifierController.kt
|

## üîí Security Implementation Details

* The app runs **foreground noise monitoring** via a service with the `RECORD_AUDIO` permission.
* Uses **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API** to transcribe audio into text.
* Transcribed messages are **encoded inside cover messages** using **zero-width Unicode characters**.
* Final messages are sent using `Intent.ACTION_SENDTO` and `AccessibilityService` for Gmail/SMS automation.

### üìÅ Google Cloud Integration

To use Google Speech-to-Text:

1. A Google API key is required.
2. Place your credentials file `google-services-speech.json` inside the `assets/` folder.
3. **Note:** For security reasons, this file is **excluded** from the Git repository.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you're cloning this repository, you must create your own credentials file:

* [**Get started with Google Cloud Speech-to-Text**](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/quickstart-client-libraries)

> ‚úÖ **Tip:** Store screenshots in `/screenshots/`, use relative Markdown paths and use HTML-style tags with width settings for cleaner layout.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

### Requirements

* Android Studio (latest stable)
* Minimum SDK: 26
* Google Cloud API Key for Speech-to-Text

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tomerlevy104/SilentGuardApp.git
```

2. Create a file named `google-services-speech.json` and place it under:

```
app/src/main/assets/
```

3. Build and run the project on a real device (not an emulator).
4. On first launch, grant the following permissions:

    * `RECORD_AUDIO`
    * `SEND_SMS`
    * `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`
    * Accessibility access for:

        * `GmailAutomationService`
        * `SmsAutomationService`

## ‚ö° Permissions Overview

The app requests the following permissions to function securely:

* `RECORD_AUDIO`: To monitor environmental noise.
* `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE`: Required for long-running audio monitoring.
* `SEND_SMS`: To notify emergency contact.
* `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`: For user alerts.
* `INTERNET`: For communication with Google Speech API.
* `BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE`: For Gmail/SMS automation.

---

## üå± Future Improvements

* Add support for multiple emergency contacts.
* Use Firebase or external DB to sync events.
* Use biometric authentication for accessing app settings.
